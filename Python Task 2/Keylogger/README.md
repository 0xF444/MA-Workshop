# Keylogger with Network Functionality
- This script works by logging all keystrokes to a file hidden in the documents directory and gets read and sent by a stream based TCP client.
- You HAVE to run the **server** first then the **client**.

I wasn't able to complete the project and do the error handling stuff due to exams.

It does its basic functionality and I was looking to improve it and make a fully functional product, I'm will attempt to improve it overtime.
