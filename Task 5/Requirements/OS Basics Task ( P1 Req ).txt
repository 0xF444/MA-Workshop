Static Analysis:

   - Identify the key Windows APIs And System Calls Used In This Code.

Dynamic Analysis:

    - Run the code in a controlled environment (e.g., a VM or sandbox).
    - Use Process Monitor or Process Explorer to observe the process and thread creation.
    - Use API Monitor to capture the API calls and verify which Windows APIs are invoked.

Deliverables:

    - A written analysis of the code, explaining the key APIs used for process/thread manipulation.
    - A process tree showing how Notepad is created and code is injected into it.
    - Screenshots/logs from tools like Procmon or API Monitor showing the behavior of the malware.
